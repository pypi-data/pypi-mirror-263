    """Calculates how similar the template appears within different locations of the input image by computing the
    normalized cross-correlation of the template and image. It returns a matrix containing the correlation coefficients.
    :param template: The N-dimensional template used for the correlation. Each dimension of the template must be smaller than the corresponding dimension of the image.
    :param image: The N-dimensional input image.
    :param mode: The mode for the `fftconvolve` function, controlling the output size. Defaults to `"full"`.
    * "full": The output includes all elements of the convolution, resulting in an output size that is the sum of the image and template sizes minus 1 in each dimension.
    * "valid": The output only contains elements that do not rely on zero-padding, resulting in an output size smaller than both the image and template sizes.
    * "same": The output has the same size as the image, centered with respect to the `"full"` output.
    :return: An N-dimensional array of the same dimensionality as the `image` but with a size that depends on the chosen `mode`.
