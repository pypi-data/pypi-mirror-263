    """
    Function for querying LLM chat while providing increasing number of documents until an answer
    is found. Documents are taken from `documents` argument. Initially first `n_starting_documents` documents
    are embedded in the query. If the LLM chat fails to find an answer, the number of documents
    is multiplied by `factor` and the question is asked again.

    Args:
        questions (ColumnReference[str]): Column with questions to be asked to the LLM chat.
        documents (ColumnReference[list[str]]): Column with documents to be provided along
             with a question to the LLM chat.
        llm_chat_model: Chat model which will be queried for answers
        n_starting_documents: Number of documents embedded in the first query.
        factor: Factor by which a number of documents increases in each next query, if
            an answer is not found.
        max_iterations: Number of times to ask a question, with the increasing number of documents.

    Returns:
        A column with answers to the question. If answer is not found, then None is returned.

    Example:

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> import pathway as pw
    >>> from pathway.xpacks.llm.llms import OpenAIChat
