# semantic_SfM
Instance segmentation for SfM point cloud. 

## Installation
Option 1 (recommended): 
```
git clone https://github.com/ZhiangChen/semantic_SfM.git
cd semantic_SfM/semantic_SfM/ssfm/
pip3 install .
```

Option 2:
```
pip3 install semantic-SfM
```

**Hardware requirements**: This project utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for panoptic segmentation. GPUs are not required for SAM but are recommended to expedite inference speed. The other parts of this project use only CPUs. As a point cloud will be stored in memory, memory usage depends on the point cloud size. 

## SSfM Architecture
[files.py](./semantic_SfM/ssfm/files.py) provides utility functions for file operation, such as point cloud and image files.

[image_segmentation.py](./semantic_SfM/ssfm/image_segmentation.py) allows to select deep learning models for instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation. 

[probabilistic_projection.py](./semantic_SfM/ssfm/probabilistic_projection.py) projects point clouds to images and creates a probablistic semantics.

[object_registration.py](./semantic_SfM/ssfm/object_registration.py) registers objects (instances and stuffs) in point clouds.



## Support Platforms and Models
This repository supports SfM products from the following platforms: 
- [WebODM](https://opendronemap.org/webodm/)
- [Agisoft](https://www.agisoft.com/)

Refer to the [docs/projection_tutorial.md](docs/projection_tutorial.md) to obtain point clouds and camera parameters from WebODM or Agisoft. The point clouds should use the format of [.las](https://laspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). 

For image segmentation, we have used Segment Anything Model from Meta: 
- [SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything)
