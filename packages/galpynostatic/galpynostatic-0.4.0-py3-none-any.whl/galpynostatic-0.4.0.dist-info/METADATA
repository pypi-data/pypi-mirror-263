**galpynostatic** is a Python package with physics-based models to predict 
optimal conditions for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries.


## Requirements

You need Python 3.9+ to run galpynostatic. All other dependencies, which are the 
usual ones of the scientific computing stack
([matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) 
and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)), are installed automatically.


## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of galpynostatic with 
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/)

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade galpynostatic
```


## Usage

To learn how to use galpynostatic you can start by following the 
[tutorials](https://galpynostatic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html)
and then read the 
[API](https://galpynostatic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).
