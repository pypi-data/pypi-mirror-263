# class TimelinedArray(np.ndarray):
#     """
#     The TimelinedArray class is a subclass of the numpy.ndarray class, which represents a multi-dimensional
#     array of homogeneous data. This class adds additional functionality
#     for working with arrays that have a time dimension, specifically:

#     It defines a Timeline class, which is also a subclass of numpy.ndarray, and represents a timeline associated
#     with the array. The Timeline class has several methods, including:
#         arange_timeline: This method takes a timeline array and creates an evenly spaced timeline based
#         on the start and stop time of the original timeline.
#         timeline_step: This method returns the average time difference between each consecutive value in the timeline.

#     TimelinedArrayIndexer class, which has several methods, including:
#         seconds_to_index: This method converts time in seconds to index value.
#         get_iindex: This method converts time in seconds to a slice object representing time.

#     __new__ : This method is used to creates a new instance of the TimelinedArray class. It takes several optional
#         arguments: timeline, time_dimension, arange_timeline, and timeline_is_arranged.
#         It creates a TimelinedArrayIndexer object with the input array,
#         and assigns the supplied timeline and dimension properties.

#     It defines an indexer to access the TimelinedArray as if it was indexed by time instead of index
#     It also adds an attribute time_dimension , and timeline_is_arranged to the class, which are used to keep track of
#     the time dimension of the array and whether the timeline is arranged or not.
#     It enables accessing the array with time instead of index, and it also tries to keep track of the time dimension
#     and the timeline, so it can be used to correct indexed time.

#     Example :
#         ...
