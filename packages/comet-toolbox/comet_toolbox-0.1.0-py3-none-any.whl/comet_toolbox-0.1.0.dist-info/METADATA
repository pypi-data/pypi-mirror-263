## Comet - A dynamic functional connectivity toolbox for multiverse analysis
[![DOI](src/comet/resources/img/badge.svg)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.21.576546)

**Important notes:**

* This package is at an early stage of development, with frequent changes being made. If you intend to use this package at this stage, I kindly ask that you contact me via the email address in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/mibur1/dfc-multiverse/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file.
* Many features are not yet tested, so there will be bugs (the question is just how many). A comprehensive testing suite and documentation will be added in the near future
* The GUI still has many bugs, so using the scripting API is recommended for now

### Current Features

![Features_image](src/comet/resources/img/content.png)

### Installation

Installation is possible through the Python Package Index (PyPI) with the pip or pip3 command, depending on your system:

```
pip install comet-toolbox
```
We further recommend using a dedicated [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) environment to mitigate the risk of potential version conflicts.


Installation from the source code of this repository is also possible:

1. Download/clone the repository
2. Open a terminal in the folder which contains the pyproject.toml file
3. Install the package via pip (or pip3, depending on your environment)
4. If you intend to implement your own modification, installing in editable mode (-e) is a helpful approach

```
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

**GUI** 

After installation, you can use the graphical user interface through the terminal by typing:

```
comet-gui
```

If you want to explore the toolbox with example data, you can load the ```src/comet/resources/simulation.txt``` file which should result in two changing connectivity patterns.

**Scripting**

If you intend to use the toolbox in a standard python script, [demo scripts](https://github.com/mibur1/dfc-multiverse/tree/main/tutorials) are provided as a starting point:

* Demo script for calculating dFC: [click here](tutorials/example_dfc.ipynb)
* Demo script for performing multiverse analysis: [click here](tutorials/example_multiverse.ipynb)
* Demo script for the multiverse analysis as presented preprint (+ additional visualizations): [click here](tutorials/example_analysis.ipynb)

### Feedback and contribution

If you have any wishes, suggestions, feedback, or encounter any bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me via email or create an issue [here](https://github.com/mibur1/dfc-multiverse/issues). Contributions or future collaboration are also welcome.
