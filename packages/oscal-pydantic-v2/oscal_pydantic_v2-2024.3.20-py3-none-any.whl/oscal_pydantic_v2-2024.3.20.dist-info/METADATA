# OSCAL Pydantic

## Description
A simple module that contains pydantic datamodels representing the OSCAL standard. They are built from the OSCAL models published by NIST at https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL

Several Python projects include data models, but importing a large project just to get access to the datamodel represents a significant overhead. This module simply provides the models.

## Installation

pip install oscal-pydantic-v2

## Usage



To import a specific model, include it in your python file:

e.g.: from oscal_pydantic import catalog
