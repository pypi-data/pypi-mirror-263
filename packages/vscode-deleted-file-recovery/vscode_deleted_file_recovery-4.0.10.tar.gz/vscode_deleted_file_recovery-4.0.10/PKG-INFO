**VSCode Deleted File Recovery Tool**

This handy tool helps you recover deleted files within your VSCode History. 

**Features:**

* **File Search:** Scans vscode history for traces of deleted files.
* **Recovery:** Restores deleted files to a designated `_recovery` folder, organized to match original file structure.

**Usage**

1. **Install:**
```bash
pip install vscode_deleted_file_recovery
```

2. Create a Python file anywhere on your PC and run the following code to search for files:
```python
from vscode_deleted_file_recovery import Recover
Recover.print_files(search_term="/Chetan/Documents/tasks")  # Replace with your desired search path
```

3. Run the following code to restore deleted files. A folder named `_recovery` will be created in the same directory where you run it:
```python
from vscode_deleted_file_recovery import Recover
Recover.restore_files(search_term="/Chetan/Documents/tasks")  # Replace with your desired search path
```

You can find restored files in the `Recovery` folder where you ran the command.
