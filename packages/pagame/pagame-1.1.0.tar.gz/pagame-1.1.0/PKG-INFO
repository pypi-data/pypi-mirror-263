Have fun.

Install using `pip install pagame`.

Run from python:

```python
    from pagame import Play

    Play()
```

See and run `examples/example_game.py` for manually starting the game.

Notes
-----
    Spotify should be open for the proper experience, but does not have to.

    In order for the game to access Spotify, you need to have a Spotify client id and secret. These
    can be obtained by creating a Spotify app (through 'developer.spotify.com'); and the client id
    and secret can be pasted directly in the script entered in terminal when runni

    When this is in order, run the `play.py`-script from the root directory.

Parameters
----------
    DELAY           : Minutes between each game.

                        If a tuple, the game will start at a random time between the two values.
