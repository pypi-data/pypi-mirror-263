# PTMULTIVIEWS
> Apache Multiviews detection & enumeration tool

ptmultiviews is a tool that allows for detection and exploitation of Apache Multiviews. <br/>
ptmultiviews can exploit Apache Multiviews by enumerating all alternatives for requested resource - this leads to an easy revelation of files that would be otherwise hard to find, such as backup files.


## Installation
```
pip install ptmultiviews
```

## Add to PATH
If you cannot invoke the script in your terminal, its probably because its not in your PATH. Fix it by running commands below.

> Add to PATH for Bash
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

> Add to PATH for ZSH
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples

```
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/                          # Test single URL for MultiViews vulnerability and retrieve alternatives
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/ -co                      # Test single URL for MultiViews vulnerability without enumeration
ptmultiviews -u https://www.example.com/index.php -o output.txt   # Saves enumerated files to output.txt
ptmultiviews -f urlList.txt                                       # Enumerate all files from urlList
```
