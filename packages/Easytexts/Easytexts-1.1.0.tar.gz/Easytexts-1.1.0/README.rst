Disclaimer

While Easytext handles common errors and is suitable for learning and small projects, it's not intended for critical or demanding projects due to its limited scope and testing.


Additional Notes

The log parameter allows you to control if certain actions are logged (printed) for debugging or tracking purposes.
The newline parameter in append allows you to control whether a newline character is added before the appended text.
