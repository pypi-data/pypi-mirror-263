"""

This module provides tools for saving Matplotlib plots as images and creating animations from these images using MoviePy.


Functions:

- tool_save_plot: Saves a Matplotlib plot as an image file.

- tool_make_animation: Creates an animation from a sequence of image files and saves it as a video file.
