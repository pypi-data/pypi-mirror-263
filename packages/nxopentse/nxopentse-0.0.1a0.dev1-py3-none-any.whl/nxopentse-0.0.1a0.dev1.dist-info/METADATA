# nxopentse (by theScriptingEngineer)
This package contains functions which you can use in your own scripts, so you don't have to write everything from scratch.
``` pip install nxopentse```

Then in your script add 
``` import nxopentse``` 

Simple example:
```
import NXOpen
import nxopentse as tse


# next line not required for nxopen, but every NXOpen journal needs an NXOpen.Session object
the_session: NXOpen.Session = NXOpen.Session.GetSession()


def main():
    tse.tools.hello()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```
