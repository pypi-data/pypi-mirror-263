# Requirements

You will need access to a [Hashboard](https://www.hashboard.com) project where:

- you have `OWNER` permissions
- it has at least one data connection
- the `HASHQUERY` feature flag is enabled _(please speak with us if you need this enabled)_

You will also need to have a clean Python 3.9+ environment (we recommend using
a virtual env tool such as `conda`).
