# Roadmap

Hashquery is in a very early stage and so the primary focus is in
shipping a Beta version which solves a subset of problems well, and
offers a clear path to grow into more and more advanced use cases.

Our vision for Hashquery is multifaceted:

**We believe Hashquery will be a world-class headless BI interface.** We
envision people using Hashquery to access their Hashboard resources in tools
like Hex, Jupyter notebooks, and inside internal tools. These integrations
could both pull and push data from Hashboard. We want to unlock the ability
for your BI tool to be the source of truth for all your data endpoints,
using it to power data products to consumers of your own.

**We believe Hashquery will be the simplest way to define complex analysis.**
We envision people using Hashquery over writing SQL, allows them to reuse and
share logic efficiently, and access analytical capabilities that are very
challenging to get right in vanilla SQL. We imagine users writing their own
abstractions on top of Hashquery, to extend it with even more capabilities,
both general purpose and specific to one's own domain.

**We believe Hashquery will be more interoperable than other approaches.**
We envision people sharing packages to provide suites of analytics to common
use cases like ad-spend, user retention, ab testing, and more. These packages
could be truly reusable across organizations, because unlike SQL snippets, they
could be deeply customizable, and agnostic to the specific databases in use (or
even their table structures).
