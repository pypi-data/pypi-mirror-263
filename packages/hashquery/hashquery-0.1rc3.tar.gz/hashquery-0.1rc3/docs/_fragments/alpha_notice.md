Hashquery is **alpha** software.

- Source compatibility is _not preserved_ between
  updates. APIs are subject to significant backwards incompatible changes at any
  time.
- Debugging errors may require inspecting Hashquery internals.
- Documented behaviors may differ from the current implementations.
