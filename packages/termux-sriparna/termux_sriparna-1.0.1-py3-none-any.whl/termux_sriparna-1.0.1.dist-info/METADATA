## Commands

Each command is assisted with a pattern type:

##### To call any number you can say "hey sriparna call XXXXXXXXXX"

You can also include country code in your query "hey sriparna call plus(country code)******" it will read the number as "+(country code)number"

Besides you can call a number from your contact list just say "sriparna call ayus", "please call ayus2" etc...

Note: In certain cases the speech recognition may not correctly identify the contact name. In such case it's better to spell the letters in the name individually. For example "sriparna please call a y u s", "call a y u s 2" etc...

##### To check battery you can say "sriparna how much is my battery", "tell my battery percentage", "hello what is my battery status", "tell my battery health"

##### To open any application you can say "open whatsapp", "sriparna please open youtube" etc...

You can open chrome, gmail, youtube with this, if you want more applications you need to specify their package names and class name in app.json

You can use [Shortcut Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rk.android.app.shortcutmaker) to find package name and package names of installed applications.

For pypi installation: 

##### To check the current weather conditions you can "hi sriparna whats the weather alike", "tell me the weather forecast", "what is the current weather condition", "how is the weather today"

##### To turn on flashlight you can say "hey please turn on the flash", "flash on", similarly you can say "hey please turn off the flash", "flash off" to turn it off.
