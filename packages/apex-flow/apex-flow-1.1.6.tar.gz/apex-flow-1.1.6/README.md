# APEX: Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations

[APEX](https://github.com/deepmodeling/APEX): Alloy Property EXplorer using simulations, is a component of the [AI Square](https://aissquare.com/) project that involves the restructuring of the [DP-Gen](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpgen) `auto_test` module to develop a versatile and extensible Python package for general alloy property testing. This package enables users to conveniently establish a wide range of property-test workflows by utilizing various computational approaches, including support for LAMMPS, VASP, and ABACUS.

## New Features Update (v1.0)
* Enable the calculation of `phonon` spectrum (v1.1.0)
* Decouple property calculations into individual sub-workflow to facilitate the customization of complex property functions
* Support one-click parallel submission of multiple workflows
* Integrate a single step test mode for `run` steps, providing an interaction method similar to `auto_test`
* Allow users to modify task submission concurrency via `group_size` and `pool_size`
* Enable users to customize `suffix` of property calculation directory so that multiple tests with identical property templates but different settings can be run within one workflow
* Refactor and optimize the command line interaction for improved usability
* Enhance robustness across diverse use scenarios, especially for the local debug mode

## 1. Overview

APEX adopts the functionality of the second-generation `auto_test` for alloy properties calculations and is developed utilizing the [dflow](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow) framework. By integrating the benefits of cloud-native workflows, APEX streamlines the intricate procedure of automatically testing various configurations and properties. Owing to its cloud-native characteristic, APEX provides users with a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction, enhancing the overall user experience by eliminating concerns related to process control, task scheduling, observability, and disaster tolerance.

The comprehensive architecture of APEX is demonstrated below:

    <p style='font-size:1.0rem; font-weight:none'>Figure 1. APEX schematic diagram</p>
</div>

APEX consists of three types of pre-defined **workflow** that users can submit: `relaxation`, `property`, and `joint`. The `relaxation` and `property` sub-workflow comprise three sequential **steps**: `Make`, `Run`, and `Post`, while the `joint` workflow essentially combines the `relaxation` and `property` workflows into a comprehensive workflow.

The `relaxation` process begins with the initial `POSCAR` supplied by the user, which is used to generate crucial data such as the final relaxed structure and its corresponding energy, forces, and virial tensor. This equilibrium state information is essential for input into the `property` workflow, enabling further calculations of alloy properties. Upon completion, the final results are automatically retrieved and downloaded to the original working directory.

In both the `relaxation` and `property` workflows, the `Make` step prepares the corresponding computational tasks. These tasks are then transferred to the `Run` step that is responsible for task dispatch, calculation monitoring, and retrieval of completed tasks (implemented through the [DPDispatcher](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dpdispatcher/tree/master) plugin). Upon completion of all tasks, the `Post` step is initiated to collect data and obtain the desired property results.

APEX currently offers computation methods for the following alloy properties:

* Equation of State (EOS)
* Elastic constants
* Surface energy
* Interstitial formation energy
* Vacancy formation energy
* Generalized stacking fault energy (Gamma line)
* Phonon spectrum

Moreover, APEX supports three types of calculators: **LAMMPS** for molecular dynamics simulations, and **VASP** and **ABACUS** for first-principles calculations.

  </div>

The Gamma line (generalized stacking fault energy) function of APEX calculates energy of a series slab structures of specific crystal plane, which displaced in the middle along a slip vector as illustrated in **Figure 2**. In APEX, the slab structrures are defined by a plane miller index and two orthogonal directions (primary and secondary) on the plane. The **slip vector is always along the primary directions** with slip length defined by users or default settings. Thus, by indicating `plane_miller` and the `slip_direction` (AKA, primary direction), a slip system can be defined.

For most common slip systems in respect to FCC, BCC and HCP crystal structures, slip direction, secondary direction and default fractional slip lengths are already documented and listed below (users are **strongly advised** to follow those pre-defined slip system, or may need to double-check the generated slab structure, as unexpected results may occur especially for system like HCP):
* FCC
  | Plane miller index | Slip direction | Secondary direction | Default slip length |

  Here is an example:
  ```json
  {
	  "type":            "gamma",
	  "skip":            true,
      "plane_miller":    [0,0,1],
      "slip_direction":  [1,0,0],
	  "hcp": {
        	"plane_miller":    [0,1,-1,1],
        	"slip_direction":  [-2,1,1,0],
          "slip_length":     [1,0,1],
          "plane_shift": 0.25
		},

      "vacuum_size": 10,
	  "add_fix": ["true","true","false"],
      "n_steps":         10
	}
  ```
  It should be noted that for various crystal structures, **users can further define slip parameters within the respective nested dictionaries, which will be prioritized for adoption**. In the example above, the slip system configuration within the "hcp" dictionary will be utilized.

##### 3.1.2.7. Phonon Spectrum
This function incorporates part of [dflow-phonon](https://github.com/Chengqian-Zhang/dflow-phonon) codes into APEX to enhance its comprehensiveness. This workflow is facilitated via [Phonopy](https://github.com/phonopy/phonopy), in conjunction with [phonoLAMMPS](https://github.com/abelcarreras/phonolammps) for LAMMPS calculations. 

**IMPORTANT!!**: it should be noticed that the **phonoLAMMPS** package must be pre-installed in the user's `run_image` to ensure accurate `LAMMPS` calculations for the phonon spectrum.

Parameters related to `Phonon` calculations are listed below:
  | Key words | Data structure | Default | Description |
  | :------------ | ----- | ----- | ------------------- |
  | primitive | Bool | False | Whether to find primitive lattice structure for phonon calculation |
  | approach | String | "linear" | Specify phonon calculation method when using `VASP`; Two options: 1. "linear" for the *Linear Response Method*, and 2. "displacement" for the *Finite Displacement Method* |
  | supercell_size | Sequence[Int] | [2, 2, 2] | Size of supercell created for calculation |
  | MESH | Sequence[Int] | None | Define the dimensions of the grid in reciprocal space, which will be utilized for the calculation of phonon frequencies and eigenvectors. For example: [8, 8, 8]; Refer to [Phonopy MESH](http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/setting-tags.html#mesh-sampling-tags) |
  | PRIMITIVE_AXES | String | None | To define the basis vectors of a primitive cell with reference to the basis vectors of a conventional cell, facilitating input cell transformation. For example: "0.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.0"; Refer to [Phonopy PRIMITIVE_AXES](http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/setting-tags.html#primitive-axes-or-primitive-axis) |
  | BAND | String | None | Indicate band path in reciprocal space as format of [Phonopy BAND](http://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/setting-tags.html#band-and-band-points); For example: "0 0 0 1/2 0 1/2, 1/2 1/2 1 0 0 0 1/2 1/2 1/2" |
  | BAND_POINTS | Int | 51 | Number of sampling points including the path ends |
  | BAND_CONNECTION | Bool | True | With this option, band connections are estimated from eigenvectors and band structure is drawn by considering band crossings. In sensitive cases, to obtain better band connections, it requires to increase the number of points calculated in band segments by the `BAND_POINTS` tag. |

When utilizing `VASP`, you have **two** primary calculation methods at your disposal: the **Linear Response Method** and the **Finite Displacement Method**.

The **Linear Response Method** has an edge over the Finite Displacement Method in that it eliminates the need for creating super-cells, thereby offering computational efficiency in certain cases. Additionally, this method is particularly well-suited for systems with anomalous phonon dispersion (like systems with Kohn anomalies), as it can precisely calculate the phonons at the specified points.

On the other hand, the **Finite Displacement Method**'s advantage lies in its versatility; it functions as an add-on compatible with any code, including those beyond the scope of density functional theory. The only requirement is that the external code can compute forces. For instance, ABACUS may lack an implementation of the Linear Response Method, but can effectively utilize the Finite Displacement Method implemented in phonon calculation.


### 3.2. Command
APEX currently supports two seperate run modes: **workflow submission** (running via dflow) and **single-step test** (running without dflow).

#### 3.2.1. Workflow Submission
APEX will execute a specific dflow workflow upon each invocation of the command in the format: `apex submit [-h] [-c [CONFIG]] [-w WORK [WORK ...]] [-d] [-f {relax,props,joint}] parameter [parameter ...]`. The type of workflow and calculation method will be automatically determined by APEX based on the parameter file provided by the user. Additionally, users can specify the **workflow type**, **configuration JSON file**, and **work directory** through an optional argument (Run `apex submit -h` for help). Here is an example to submit a `joint` workflow:
```shell
apex submit param_relax.json param_props.json -c ./global_bohrium.json -w 'dp_demo_0?' 'eam_demo'
```
if no config JSON and work directory is specified, `./global.json` and `./` will be passed as default values respectively. 

#### 3.2.2. Single-Step Test
APEX also provides a **single-step test mode**, which can run `Make` `run` and `Post` step individually under local enviornment. **Please note that one needs to run command under the work directory in this mode.** Users can invoke them by format of `apex test [-h] [-m [MACHINE]] parameter {make_relax,run_relax,post_relax,make_props,run_props,post_props}` (Run `apex test -h` for help). Here is a example to do relaxation in this mode:
1. Firstly, generate relaxation tasks by
   ```shell
   apex test param_relax.json make_relax
   ```
2. Then dispatch tasks by
   ```shell
   apex test param_relax.json run_relax -m machine.json
   ```
   where `machine.json` is a JSON file to define dispatch method, containing `machine`, `resources`, `task` dictionaries and `run_command` as listed in [DPDispatcherâ€™s documentation](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/index.html). Here is an example to submit tasks to a [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com) managed remote HPC:
   ```json
    {
      "run_command": "lmp -i in.lammps -v restart 0",
      "machine": {
          "batch_type": "Slurm",
          "context_type": "SSHContext",
          "local_root" : "./",
          "remote_root": "/hpc/home/hku/zyl/Downloads/remote_tasks",
          "remote_profile":{
              "hostname": "***.**.**.**",
              "username": "USERNAME",
              "password": "PASSWD",
              "port": 22,
              "timeout": 10
          }
      },
      "resources":{
          "number_node": 1,
          "cpu_per_node": 4,
          "gpu_per_node": 0,
          "queue_name": "apex_test",
          "group_size": 1,
          "module_list": ["deepmd-kit/2.1.0/cpu_binary_release"],
          "custom_flags": [
                "#SBATCH --partition=xlong",
                "#SBATCH --ntasks=1",
                "#SBATCH --mem=10G",
                "#SBATCH --nodes=1",
                "#SBATCH --time=1-00:00:00"
          ]
      }
    }
   ```
3. Finally, as all tasks are finished, post process by
   ```shell
   apex test param_relax.json post_relax
   ```
The property test can follow similar approach.
## 4. Quick Start
We present several case studies as introductory illustrations of APEX, tailored to distinct user scenarios. For our demonstration, we will utilize a [LAMMPS_example](./examples/lammps_demo) to compute the Equation of State (EOS) and elastic constants of molybdenum in both Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) phases. To begin, we will examine the files prepared within the working directory for this specific case.

```
lammps_demo
â”œâ”€â”€ confs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ std-bcc
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ POSCAR
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ std-fcc
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ POSCAR
â”œâ”€â”€ frozen_model.pb
â”œâ”€â”€ global_bohrium.json
â”œâ”€â”€ global_hpc.json
â”œâ”€â”€ param_joint.json
â”œâ”€â”€ param_props.json
â””â”€â”€ param_relax.json
```
There are three types of parameter files and two types of global config files, as well as a Deep Potential file of molybdenum `frozen_model.pb`. Under the directory of `confs`, structure file `POSCAR` of both phases have been prepared respectively.

### 4.1. In the Bohrium
The most efficient method for submitting an APEX workflow is through the preconfigured execution environment of dflow on the [Bohrium platform](https://bohrium.dp.tech). To do this, it may be necessary to create an account on Bohrium. Below is an example of a global.json file for this approach.

```json
{
    "dflow_host": "https://workflows.deepmodeling.com",
    "k8s_api_server": "https://workflows.deepmodeling.com",
    "batch_type": "Bohrium",
    "context_type": "Bohrium",
    "email": "YOUR_EMAIL",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWD",
    "program_id": 1234,
    "apex_image_name":"registry.dp.tech/dptech/prod-11045/apex-dependencies:1.1.0",
    "lammps_image_name": "registry.dp.tech/dptech/prod-11461/phonopy:v1.2",
    "lammps_run_command":"lmp -in in.lammps",
    "scass_type":"c8_m31_1 * NVIDIA T4"
}
```
Then, one can submit a relaxation workflow via:
```shell
apex submit param_relax.json -c global_bohrium.json
```
Remember to replace `email`, `password` and `program_id` of your own before submission. As for image, you can either build your own or use public images from Bohrium or pulling from the Docker Hub. Once the workflow is submitted, one can monitor it at https://workflows.deepmodeling.com.

### 4.2. In a Local Argo Service
Additionally, a dflow environment can be installed in a local computer by executing [installation scripts](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/scripts) located in the dflow repository (users can also refer to the [dflow service setup manual](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow/tree/master/tutorials) for more details). For instance, to install on a Linux system without root access:
```shell
bash install-linux-cn.sh
```
This process will automatically configure the required local tools, including Docker, Minikube, and Argo service, with the default port set to `127.0.0.1:2746`. Consequently, one can modify the `global_hpc.json` file to submit a workflow to this container without a Bohrium account. Here is an example:

```json
{
    "apex_image_name":"zhuoyli/apex_amd64",
    "run_image_name": "zhuoyli/apex_amd64",
    "run_command":"lmp -in in.lammps",
    "batch_type": "Slurm",
    "context_type": "SSHContext",
    "local_root" : "./",
    "remote_root": "/hpc/home/zyl/Downloads/remote_tasks",
    "remote_host": "123.12.12.12",
    "remote_username": "USERNAME",
    "remote_password": "PASSWD",
    "resources":{
        "number_node": 1,
        "cpu_per_node": 4,
        "gpu_per_node": 0,
        "queue_name": "apex_test",
        "group_size": 1,
        "module_list": ["deepmd-kit/2.1.0/cpu_binary_release"],
        "custom_flags": [
            "#SBATCH --partition=xlong",
            "#SBATCH --ntasks=4",
            "#SBATCH --mem=10G",
            "#SBATCH --nodes=1",
            "#SBATCH --time=1-00:00:00"
            ]
       }
}

```
In this example, we attempt to distribute tasks to a remote node managed by [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com). Users can replace the relevant parameters within the `machine` dictionary or specify `resources` and `tasks` according to [DPDispatcher](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/dpdispatcher/en/latest/index.html) rules.

For the APEX image, it is publicly available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and can be pulled automatically. Users may also choose to pull the image beforehand or create their own Docker image in the Minikube environment locally using a [Dockerfile](./docs/Dockerfile) (please refer to [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) for building instructions) to expedite pod initialization.

Then, one can submit a relaxation workflow via:
```shell
apex submit param_relax.json -c global_hpc.json
```

Upon submission of the workflow, progress can be monitored at https://127.0.0.1:2746.

### 4.3. In a Local Environment
If your local computer experiences difficulties connecting to the internet, APEX offers a **workflow local debug mode** that allows the flow to operate in a basic `Python3` environment, independent of the Docker container. However, users will **not** be able to monitor the workflow through the Argo UI.

To enable this feature, users can add an additional optional argument `-d` to the origin submission command, as demonstrated below:

```shell
apex submit -d param_relax.json -c global_hpc.json
```

In this approach, uses are not required to specify an image for executing APEX. Rather, APEX should be pre-installed in the default `Python3` environment to ensure proper functioning.
