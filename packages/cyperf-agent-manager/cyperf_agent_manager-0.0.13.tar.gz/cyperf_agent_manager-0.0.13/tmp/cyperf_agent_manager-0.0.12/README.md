## Installation

```console
pip install cyperf-agent-manager
```

_If `pip` command is not found on your system then use the following commands to install `pip`._

```cosnole
$ wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

## CLI
This package installs a command called `cyperf-agent-manager` that is a very thin wrapper over `cyperf_agent_manager` package. This top level commands has many subcommands that can be used to execute different operations on multiple agents at simultaneously.

The command details can be found by running the script with `--help` option, as shown in the following blocks.
```
[PROMPT]:~$ cyperf-agent-manager --help
Usage: cyperf-agent-manager [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  install-build
  reload
  set-controller
  set-test-interface
```
### Installing an agent build on multiple agents
```
[PROMPT]:~$ cyperf-agent-manager install-build --help
Usage: cyperf-agent-manager install-build [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --agent-ips NETWORK ADDRESS LIST
                                  One or more agent names (IP addresses or
                                  hostnames). Use quotation marks (`'` or `"`)
                                  for whitespace (` `) separated values. Other

  --username TEXT                 A common username for all the agents.
                                  [default: cyperf]
  --override-password             This along with --password option should be
                                  used for non default password.
  --password TEXT                 A common password for all the agents.
  --key-file FILE                 A common key file for opening ssh
                                  connections to all the agents.
  --debian-file-path FILE         Path to the .deb file to be installed.

## Password Override
Even though CyPerf agents are deployed from official machice images provided CyPerf team, CyPerf can also installed on arbitrary machines. All CyPerf machine images come with a default password. `cyperf-agent-manager` by default tries to connect with that default password. Obviously the default password won't work for arbitrary machines. In those cases the password has to be overriden. The options `--override-password` and `--password` are there for that purpose only but using `--password` directly in CLI is unsafe. In that case the actual password will be visible in plain text. A better option is to use only the `--override-password` option in CLI and then a password prompt will come up. The user will be able to type the password in an invisible way. Please see the example below.
_If a key file is provided using `--key-file` option then `cyperf-agent-manager` will try to open a connection with each agent using the key file first. If authentication fails with the key file then it will try the password._

### Example
```
[PROMPT]:$ cyperf-agent-manager reload --agent-ips '10.36.75.69 10.36.75.70' --override-password
Password [cyperf]:

## Module
The python module installed by this package in `cyperf_agent_manager`. This can be used from a custom python script. Here is a smaple code that uses the `cyperf_agent_manager` module.
```
import cyperf_agent_manager.agent_manager as caMgr

agentIPs     = [ '192.168.0.1', '192.168.0.2' ]
controllerIP = '192.168.100.1'
testIface    = 'ens192'
debFile      = './tiger_x86_64_ixos-8.50_ixstack-raw_release_1.0.3.575.deb'

agentMgr     = caMgr.CyPerfAgentManager(agentIPs)

agentMgr.InstallBuild (debFile)
agentMgr.ControllerSet (controllerIP)
agentMgr.Reload ()
agentMgr.SetTestInterface (testIface)
```
