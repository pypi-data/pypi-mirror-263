videotooimage is a Python package that provides functionality to convert video files into sequences of images. It utilizes the OpenCV library (cv2) to process video files and extract frames. This package is useful for tasks such as video analysis, object detection, and machine learning model training using video data.

    Features:
    - Convert video files (e.g., .mp4, .avi, .mov) into sequences of images.
    - Works with various video codecs and formats supported by OpenCV.
    - No need to create sub folders for directories, Created automatically
    - Very useful for machine learning training purposes,
        the original folder structure is kept as is it.
