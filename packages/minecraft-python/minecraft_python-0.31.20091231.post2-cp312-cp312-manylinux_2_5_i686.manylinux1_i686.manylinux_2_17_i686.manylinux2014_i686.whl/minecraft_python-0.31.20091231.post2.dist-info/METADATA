## Minecraft: Python Edition

![Minecraft](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

_**Minecraft: Python Edition**_ is a project that strives to recreate each and every old Minecraft version in Python 3 using the **Pyglet** multimedia library and **Cython** for performance.

The project is currently working on the Indev versions of Minecraft.
The latest version is **Indev 0.31 20091231-2** as released on _**December 31, 2009**_.

This version is the last version of Minecraft released in 2009, and the first version of Indev released in survival mode.
This version introduces the player inventory screen and isometric screenshots, the latter of which is exclusive to Indev versions as the world is not infinite.

You can learn more about this version [on the Minecraft wiki.](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_Indev_0.31_20091231-2)

### Organization

This project's commits represent the Python versions of each Minecraft Java game version.
You can view source code changes between game versions by checking the commit history or comparing branches.
To play any version, specify it in the `pip install` command as demonstrated below.

### General Usage

*Pyglet*, *Cython*, *Pillow*, and *NumPy* are required dependencies and can easily be installed with *pip*. Use the versions specified in `requirements.txt`.

While the late Classic versions and later Indev versions feature audio, this version does not.

To easily install this version of *Minecraft: Python Edition*, just run `python -m pip install minecraft-python==0.31.20091231-2`.

Alternatively, for a manual Cython build, run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`.

Run `python -m mc.net.minecraft.Minecraft` to launch the game. *Minecraft: Python Edition* should be compatible with any modern platform that supports OpenGL and Cython.

Run with the argument `-fullscreen` to open the window in fullscreen mode. The argument `-creative` will force the game to be in creative mode.

### Gameplay

Press I to open your inventory. Tools which were newly added in this version will be in the inventory, but they serve no function yet.
Press F7 to take a cool isometric screenshot and F5 to toggle rain. Other keys are listed in the regular options menu.

The only mobs around are the Rana mobs, but they don't drop anything when killed. Arrows and mushrooms are unusable.

### Additional Notes

The `mc.resources` directory contains all of the textures and sounds that this version uses. However,
the textures are only there for convenience, as all of the texture buffers are already preloaded
in the `mc.Resources` module.

This would have been much more challenging to work on without the great tools provided by [RetroMCP-Java](https://github.com/MCPHackers/RetroMCP-Java).
