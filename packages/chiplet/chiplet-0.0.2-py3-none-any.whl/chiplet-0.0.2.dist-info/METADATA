### Substrate Chiplets

> A chiplet is a smaller, modular piece of silicon containing integrated circuits, designed to be combined with other 
chiplets on a single substrate to form a larger, composite semiconductor device. 
> 
> This approach allows for more 
efficient manufacturing, as each chiplet can be optimized for a specific function, 
improving performance and scalability while reducing costs and development time compared to traditional 
monolithic chip designs. 
> 
> Chiplets are interconnected via a substrate that facilitates communication between them, 
often using advanced packaging technologies like 2.5D and 3D integration.
