class Identifiable():
    """
    The fingerprint of a Record in CaosDB.

    This class contains the information that is used by the CaosDB Crawler to identify Records.
    On one hand, this can be the ID or a Record or the path of a File.
    On the other hand, in order to check whether a Record exits in the CaosDB Server, a query can
    be created using the information contained in the Identifiable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    record_type: str, this RecordType has to be a parent of the identified object
    name: str, the name of the identified object
    properties: dict, keys are names of Properties; values are Property values
                Note, that lists are not checked for equality but are interpreted as multiple
                conditions for a single Property.
    path: str, In case of files: The path where the file is stored.
    backrefs: list, TODO future
