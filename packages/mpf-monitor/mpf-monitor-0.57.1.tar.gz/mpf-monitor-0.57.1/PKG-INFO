MPF Monitor (mpf-monitor)
=========================

<img align="right" width="300" src="mpf-monitor-logo.png"/>

This package is for the Mission Pinball Framework (MPF) Monitor
(mpf-monitor).

The MPF monitor is a graphical app that connects to a live running
instance of MPF and shows the status of various devices. (LEDs,
switches, ball locks, etc.). You can add a picture of your playfield and
drag-and-drop devices to their proper locations so you can interact with
your machine when you're not near your physical machine.

The MPF Monitor can run on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It uses PyQt6
(Python bindings for Qt6) for its visual framework.

Installation & Instructions
---------------------------

Full instructions for installing and using the MPF monitor are included
in the MPF documentation here: https://missionpinball.org/
