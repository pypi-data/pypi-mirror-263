# mzData2Mat
Welcome ! mzData2Mat is a Python package which converts mzData.xml files (version 1.05) into mat files which matlab can load and use.

## Compatible hardware
### macOS
mzdata2mat has been developped with a macOS environment. At this time, `macOS Sonoma 14.0` is officially supported, other macOS versions could be supported as long as they follow the requirements listed below.

## Windows
madata2mat has not been tested yet on any Windows machine for now. Support will soon be added (if applicable).

## Requirements
### Other than Python
This packages __requires a javascript interpreter__ such as __node.js__. We recommand downloading it and installing it a [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en), this package has been tested with node.js only. There is no official support for other interpreters at this time.

### Python version
This package has been developped with Python `3.12.1` however, other python versions are actively being tested to add other versions as soon as possible.

### Python packages
To be able to use this package, the following packages need to be also installed on the target environment :
```python 
    pydantic>=2.6.4
    PyExecJS==1.5.1
    mat4py>=0.6.0
```
# Installation
From your terminal run the following command to install mzdata2mat into your environment :
```python
pip install mzdata2mat
```
If you have multiple instances of Python installed, run this command with the chosen Python interpreter to install mzdata2mat in the corresponding Python installation :
```python
<pathToPythonApp> -m pip install mzdata2mat
```
When the command terminates, you have successfully installed mzdata2mat !

To verfiy if the installation was successful, run in your terminal this command :
```python
$ mzdata2mat-verify
```
This command will attempt to convert an example .mzdata.xml file into a .mat file. If everything goes right, you will get this message :
```
$ mzdata2mat - Ready to use !
```
The example file (.mzdata.xml) will be copied in the current working directory and the converted file (.mat) will be added as soon as the conversion finishes.

If an error occurs, this probably means that you do not have __node.js__ installed on your machine.
# Usage
To use mzdata2mat, import it like follows:
```python
from mzdata2mat import mzDataManager
```
Here we import the main class used for the conversion.
Now we initilize the class :

```python
converterAgent = mzDataManager(useDirectory=False)
```
If all mzData files are stored in the same directory, we can specify the parameter `mzDataPath` instead of `useDirectory`.

From now we can call the `mzDataXMLread`function to read the `.mzData.xml' file:
```python
data = converterAgent.mzDataXMLread(fileName=path2mzDataFile)
```
We can now save this file with the function `saveMatfile`:
```python
converterAgent.saveMatfile(mzData=data, dir2save=someDirectory)
```
You have now successfully converted a mzData file into mat files ! 
Congratulations !
