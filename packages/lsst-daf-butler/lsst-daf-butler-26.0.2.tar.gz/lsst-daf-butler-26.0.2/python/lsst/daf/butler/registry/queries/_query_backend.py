        Notes
        -----
        Dimension relationships include both many-to-one implied dependencies
        and many-to-many joins backed by "always-join" dimension elements, and
        it's important to join in the dimension table that defines a
        relationship in any query involving dimensions that are a superset of
        that relationship.  For example, let's consider a relation tree that
        joins dataset existence-check relations for two dataset types, with
        dimensions ``{instrument, exposure, detector}`` and ``{instrument,
        physical_filter}``.  The joined relation appears to have all dimension
        keys in its expanded graph present except ``band``, and the system
        could easily correct this by joining that dimension in directly.  But
        it's also missing the ``{instrument, exposure, physical_filter}``
        relationship we'd get from the ``exposure`` dimension's own relation
        (``exposure`` implies ``physical_filter``) and the similar
        ``{instrument, physical_filter, band}`` relationship from the
        ``physical_filter`` dimension relation; we need the relationship logic
        to recognize that those dimensions need to be joined in as well in
        order for the full relation to have rows that represent valid data IDs.

        The implementation of this method relies on the assumption that
        `LeafRelation` objects always have rows that are consistent with all
        defined relationships (i.e. are valid data IDs).  This is true for not
        just dimension relations themselves, but anything created from queries
        based on them, including datasets and query results.  It is possible to
        construct `LeafRelation` objects that don't satisfy this criteria (e.g.
        when accepting in user-provided data IDs), and in this case
        higher-level guards or warnings must be provided.``
