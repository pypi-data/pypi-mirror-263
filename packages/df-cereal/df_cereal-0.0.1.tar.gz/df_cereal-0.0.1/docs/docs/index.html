It aims to be a referencer implementation for serializing dataframes with pyarrow.</p><p>Dataframe serialization is hard, and it is the source of performance regresssions. Arrow seems to be the way forward for dataframe libraries and for dataframe serialization. This project is meant to be a colaborative reference for library authors who want to do high performance serialization.</p><h2 id="planned-features-include">Planned features include</h2><ul><li>A repo that demonstrates different ways to serialize dataframes, with MVP implementations that are easy to adapt</li><li>Benchmarks for different serialization techniques</li><li>Tests for all of this</li><li>Examples of more complex dataframe constructs, and how they appear in JS.
