## Simple Example

In this section, we show how to configure and use a basic logger with `loggingpython`. First, we import the package and create a logger:
``` python
import loggingpython as lp

# Create a basic logger
logger = lp.getBasicLogger()
```

This creates a logger with a Filehandler and a Consolehandler, the Consolehandler has colors in the message.

This creates a logger without handlers.
```python
import loggingpython as lp

# Create a logger
logger = lp.getLogger()

# Create a FileHandler
filehandler = lp.FileHandler(logger.name)
logger.addHandler(filehandler)

# Create a Consolehandler
consolehandler = lp.ConsoleHandler()
logger.addHandler(consolehandler)

# Create a JSONhandler
jsonhandler = lp.JSONHandler(logger.name)
logger.addHandler(jsonhandler)

# Create a SQLHandler
sqlhandler = lp.SQLHandler(logger.name)
logger.addHandler(sqlhandler)

# Creat a CSVHandler
csvhandler = lp.CSVHandler(logger.name)
logger.addHandler(csvhandler)
```

Now, we can use the logger to generate various types of log messages:

``` python
# Logging messages at different levels
logger.debug("This is a debug message.")
logger.info("This is an info message.")
logger.warning("This is a warning.")
logger.error("This is an error.")
logger.critical("This is a critical error.")

#Log message with an exception
try:
    1 / 0 
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    logger.error("An exception occurred: %s", e)
```

The file handler saves the logs in the `logs/file.log` directory.

This example shows how to configure and use a basic logger to generate various types of log messages.
