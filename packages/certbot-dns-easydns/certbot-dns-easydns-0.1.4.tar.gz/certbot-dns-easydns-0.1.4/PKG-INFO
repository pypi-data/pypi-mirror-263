=====================

EasyDNS_ DNS Authenticator plugin for Certbot_

This plugin automates the process of completing a ``dns-01`` challenge by
creating, and subsequently removing, TXT records using the EasyDNS REST API.

Configuration of EasyDNS
------------------------

As an EasyDNS_ user with at least one domain being served by EasyDNS,
log into the control panel and navigate under "User" to "Security" and
then to the bottom, to the REST API section.  You may need to complete
the registration form in order to receive credentials, but they should
be issued automatically once the form is submitted.

The user token is like a username or public key, but should probably
still be kept confidential.  The API key is issued by clicking
"Regenerate" and is only shown for a short time in the browser and
then never again; be ready to copy it and stuff it into some sort
of protected datastore.  Both must be used together to authenticate
with the API.  See below about how to create a file for the credentials.

It is possible to direct the endpoint, but currently there is only ever
one correct value: ``https://rest.easydns.net``

.. _EasyDNS: https://www.easydns.com/
.. _certbot: https://certbot.eff.org/

Installation
------------

::

   pip install certbot
   pip install certbot-dns-easydns


Named Arguments
---------------

To start using DNS authentication for EasyDNS, pass the following arguments on
certbot's command line:

===================================== ==============================================
``--authenticator dns-easydns``       select the authenticator plugin (Required)

``--dns-easydns-credentials``         EasyDNS Remote User credentials
                                       INI file (Required)

``--dns-easydns-propagation-seconds`` | waiting time for DNS to propagate before asking
                                      |  the ACME server to verify the DNS record
                                      | (Default: 120, Recommended: >= 600)
===================================== ==============================================


Credentials
-----------

Credentials for access to the EasyDNS REST API are required in order
for this plugin to work.  The credentials are stored in a separate INI
file which should have mode 0600 for security (see below).  The file
is often stored in a location such as ``/root/.secrets`` or
``/etc/letsencrypt/.secrets`` and perhaps named for the authenticator,
e.g. ``/root/.secrets/easydns.ini``.  Henceforth we shall refer to
this file as ``credentials.ini``.

An example ``credentials.ini`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

   dns_easydns_usertoken = myremoteuser
   dns_easydns_userkey = verysecureremoteuserpassword
   dns_easydns_endpoint = https://rest.easydns.net


The full path to this file can be provided interactively or by using
the ``--dns-easydns-credentials`` command-line argument; that value
appears in the ``domain.conf`` which Certbot creates to describe the
domain which is the subject of the cert.  Certbot records the absolute
path to this file for use during renewal, but does not store the
file's contents.

The ``domain.conf`` file is created by ``certbot`` if it is not
present, when the SSL cert is first provisioned by running the
``certbot certonly`` command (example below).  If the
``--dns-easydns-credentials`` option is used, the resulting
``domain.conf`` file should reflect the location provided without any
need for editing by the user.  However, if the credentials file
changes locations, then the ``domain.conf`` file will need to be
updated to reflect the new location.  It is worthy of note that in the
``domain.conf`` file, the parameter uses underscores in place of
hyphens.

.. note::

   Please note that providing the endpoint is required, though it is
   currently always the same; this is for forward compatibility.

.. caution::

   You should protect these API credentials as you would the
   password to your EasyDNS account. Users who can read this file can use these
   credentials to issue arbitrary API calls on your behalf. Users who can cause
   Certbot to run using these credentials can complete a ``dns-01`` challenge to
   acquire new certificates or revoke existing certificates for associated
   domains, even if those domains aren't being managed by this server.

   Certbot will emit a warning if it detects that the credentials file can be
   accessed by other users on your system. The warning reads "Unsafe permissions
   on credentials configuration file", followed by the path to the credentials
   file. This warning will be emitted each time Certbot uses the credentials file,
   including for renewal, and cannot be silenced except by addressing the issue
   (e.g., by using a command like ``chmod 600`` to restrict access to the file).


Examples
--------

To acquire a single certificate for both ``example.com`` and
``*.example.com``, waiting 900 seconds for DNS propagation:

.. code-block:: bash

   certbot certonly \
     --authenticator dns-easydns \
     --dns-easydns-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
     --dns-easydns-propagation-seconds 900 \
     --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
     --agree-tos \
     --rsa-key-size 4096 \
     -d 'example.com' \
     -d '*.example.com'


Docker
------

In order to create a docker container with a certbot-dns-easydns installation,
create an empty directory with the following ``Dockerfile``:

.. code-block:: docker

    FROM certbot/certbot
    RUN pip install certbot-dns-easydns

Proceed to build the image::

    docker build -t certbot/dns-easydns .

Once that's finished, the application can be run as follows::

    docker run --rm \
       -v /var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt \
       -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
       --cap-drop=all \
       certbot/dns-easydns certonly \
       --authenticator dns-easydns \
       --dns-easydns-propagation-seconds 900 \
       --dns-easydns-credentials \
           /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
       --no-self-upgrade \
       --keep-until-expiring --non-interactive --expand \
       --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
       -d example.com -d '*.example.com'

It is suggested to secure the folder as follows::
chown root:root /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
