### Changes to ```baseline.yaml``` 

>> ⚠️ Following regards changes made to ```baseline.yaml``` **only** in this repository  

Tests for ```.csv```/```metadata.yaml``` extraction has example dataset that was obtained by using baseline.yaml on sample cell. If changes to ```baseline.yaml``` are absolutely necessary, then either test should be made to use old ```baseline.yaml```, or example dataset must be remade with new ```baseline.yaml ```. 

In case when new measurement needs to be added, those concerns are not valid.
