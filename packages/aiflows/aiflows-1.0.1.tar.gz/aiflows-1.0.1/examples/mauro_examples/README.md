# Decentralized Flows

This directory contains notebook examples on how to run flows with colink.
Notebooks are self-sufficient, i.e. you don't need to run any background processes unless explicitly mentioned in the notebook.

Recommended order for going through notebooks:
1. ReverseNumber
2. ReverseNumber-multiuser
3. ChatFlow-languages
4. InteractiveChatFlow
