# ESDS: An Extensible Simulator For Distributed Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems
[![Dependency](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-v3.10-blue)](https://www.python.org/) [![Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/manzerbredes/esds/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/manzerbredes/esds/-/tree/main)

### What is ESDS ?
It is a short learning curve and coarse-grain simulator for distributed systems. ESDS contains the building blocks for the simulation of *Distributed Systems*, *Cyber-Physical Systems* (CPS), *Wireless Sensors Networks* (WSN) etc. It is designed to improve the flexibility/faithfulness of nodes implementations and mitigate the learning curve compare to existing simulators. 

ESDS is part of a research project. Studies and validation experiments are available online. For more details please visit http://todo.com.

### Installation
`> pip install esds`

To ensure that esds is properly working and installed on your system, you can clone this repository, and run the simulation tests with one of the following scripts:
- `tests/run.sh`
- `tests/run.py`

### Features
- Easy to use
- Small API
- Agent-based: node implementations are located in dedicated python files
- Wireless interferences detection (i.e not modelization)
- Node mobility (through dynamic updates of the network matrices)
- Node plugins (e.g: energy consumption)

### What ESDS does not implements ?
- Network protocols (e.g IP/TCP/UDP)
- Wireless physical layer models (e.g: Friis and Log-Distance models, modulation, RSSI)
- Routing algorithms (e.g: Shortest path)
- And much more!

### Simulation API
- `api.args`
- `api.send(<int>,<data>,<size>,<dst>)`
- `api.sendt(<int>,<data>,<size>,<dst>,<t>)`
- `api.receive(<int>)`
- `api.receivet(<int>,<t>)`
- `api.wait(<t>)`
- `api.wait_end()`
- `api.log(<message>)`
- `api.read(<register>)`
- `api.turn_on()`
- `api.turn_off()`

  - [example/receiver.py](https://gitlab.com/manzerbredes/esds/-/blob/main/example/receiver.py)

### Documentation
The documentation of ESDS is available in the [user manual](https://gitlab.com/manzerbredes/esds/-/blob/main/manual/manual.pdf).
