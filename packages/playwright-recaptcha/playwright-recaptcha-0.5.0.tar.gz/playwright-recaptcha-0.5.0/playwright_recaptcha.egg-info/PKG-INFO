# Playwright-reCAPTCHA
A Python library for solving reCAPTCHA v2 and v3 with Playwright.

## Solving reCAPTCHA v2
reCAPTCHA v2 is solved by using the following methods:

- Solving the audio challenge by transcribing the audio using the Google speech recognition API and entering the text as the response.
- Solving the image challenge using the [CapSolver](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/register?inviteCode=m4C4_LnVN_re) API for image classification.

## Solving reCAPTCHA v3
The solving of reCAPTCHA v3 is done by the browser itself, so this library simply waits for the browser to make a POST request to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/reload or https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/reload and parses the response to get the `g-recaptcha-response` token.

---

All solvers return the `g-recaptcha-response` token, which is required for form submissions. If you are unsure about the version of reCAPTCHA being used, you can check out [this blog post](https://www.capsolver.com/blog/reCAPTCHA/identify-what-recaptcha-version-is-being-used) for more information.

## Installation
    pip install playwright-recaptcha

This library requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system in order to convert the audio challenge from reCAPTCHA v2 into text.

|   OS    |        Command         |
| :-----: | :--------------------: |
| Debian  | apt-get install ffmpeg |
|  MacOS  |  brew install ffmpeg   |
| Windows | winget install ffmpeg  |

You can also download the latest static build from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

> **Note**
> Make sure to have the ffmpeg and ffprobe binaries in your system's PATH so that pydub can find them.

## reCAPTCHA v2 Example
For more reCAPTCHA v2 examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/Xewdy444/Playwright-reCAPTCHA/tree/main/examples/recaptchav2).

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from playwright_recaptcha import recaptchav2

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = playwright.firefox.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo")

    with recaptchav2.SyncSolver(page) as solver:
        token = solver.solve_recaptcha(wait=True)
        print(token)
```

If you would like to solve the image challenge, you can set the `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` environment variable to your [CapSolver](https://dashboard.capsolver.com/passport/register?inviteCode=m4C4_LnVN_re) API key. You can also pass the API key as an argument to `recaptchav2.SyncSolver()` with `capsolver_api_key="your_api_key"`. Then, set `image_challenge=True` in `solver.solve_recaptcha()`.

```python
with recaptchav2.SyncSolver(page, capsolver_api_key="your_api_key") as solver:
    token = solver.solve_recaptcha(wait=True, image_challenge=True)
    print(token)
```

## reCAPTCHA v3 Example
For more reCAPTCHA v3 examples, see the [examples folder](https://github.com/Xewdy444/Playwright-reCAPTCHA/tree/main/examples/recaptchav3).

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from playwright_recaptcha import recaptchav3

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = playwright.firefox.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()

    with recaptchav3.SyncSolver(page) as solver:
        page.goto("https://antcpt.com/score_detector/")
        token = solver.solve_recaptcha()
        print(token)
```

It is best to initialize the solver before navigating to the page with the reCAPTCHA v3 challenge. This is because the solver adds a listener for the POST request to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/reload or https://www.google.com/recaptcha/enterprise/reload and if the request is made before the listener is added, the `g-recaptcha-response` token will not be captured.
