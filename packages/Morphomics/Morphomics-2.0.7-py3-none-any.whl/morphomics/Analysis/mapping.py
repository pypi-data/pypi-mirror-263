def get_reference_atlas(location, region):
    '''The function `get_reference_atlas` loads data from a specific location and region and returns the
    reference Palantir and conditions from the complete data.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    location
        Location refers to the directory or path where the reference atlas data is stored. It could be a
    file path or a URL where the data is located.
    region
        Region refers to a specific area or location within the reference atlas. It could be a particular
    region of interest within the atlas data, such as a specific brain region, organ, or anatomical
    structure.
    
    Returns
    -------
        The function `get_reference_atlas` is returning two values: `complete_data["reference_palantir"]`
    and `complete_data["conditions"]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    location
        The `location` parameter is a string that represents the directory or path where the data file is
    stored.
    region
        Region refers to a specific area or location, such as a country, state, city, or any other
    geographical or administrative division. It is used to specify the region for which you want to
    retrieve data or information in the context of the `get_model` function.
    
    Returns
    -------
        The function `get_model` is returning the values of `complete_data["reg_x"]` and
    `complete_data["reg_y"]` from the loaded object `ReferenceAtlas_%s` located in the specified
    `location` and `region`.

    '''The function `calculate_hvg` calculates the highly variable genes (HVGs) based on the standard
    deviation of the input training data.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    train_data
        It looks like the function `calculate_hvg` is designed to calculate highly variable genes (HVG)
    based on the standard deviation of the training data. The function takes two parameters:
    `train_data` which is the input training data and `n_hvg` which is the number of highly variable
    n_hvg
        The `n_hvg` parameter in the `calculate_hvg` function represents the number of highly variable
    genes (HVG) that you want to identify from the `train_data`. This parameter is used to determine the
    top `n_hvg` genes with the highest standard deviation, which are considered
    
    Returns
    -------
        The function `calculate_hvg` returns the indices of the top `n_hvg` highly variable genes (HVGs)
    based on the standard deviation of the `train_data`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X_train
        It seems like your message got cut off. Could you please provide more information about the X_train
    parameter so that I can assist you further?

    information is missing. Could you please provide more details or let me know if you need help with
    something specific related to the `y_train` parameter?
    
    Returns
    -------
        The function `train_model` returns two trained linear regression models `reg_x` and `reg_y`.

    Parameters

    message got cut off. Could you please provide more details or let me know how I can assist you

    method, optional
        The `method` parameter in the `map_coordinates` function is used to specify the mapping method to
    be applied to the predicted x and y coordinates. The default method is "median", but you can also
    pass other methods such as "mean", "max", "min", etc. to customize how
    return_std, optional
        The `return_std` parameter in the `map_coordinates` function determines whether the standard
    deviation values should be included in the output data. If `return_std` is set to `True`, the
    standard deviation values for both x and y predictions will be calculated and included in the output
    dictionary. If it
    
    Returns
    -------
        The function `map_coordinates` returns a dictionary containing the predicted x and y coordinates
    based on the input test_ph using regression models reg_x and reg_y. The method used for mapping the
    coordinates (either "median" or another specified method) is applied to the predicted values. If
