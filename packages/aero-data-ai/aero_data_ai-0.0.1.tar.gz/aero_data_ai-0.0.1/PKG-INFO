Hey!
Team Aero Data AI this side,
The sole purpose of this library is to help you increase the shareability of your codebase. It simplifies managing the root path of your project directory across all your Python files, allowing you to effortlessly access files without using absolute path of your system in project's code files on your system. Below are the some functions you can use:

> set_project_path(project_name:str, project_directory_path:str)
Use this function to set the path of your project directory.
    The function "get_project_path" can be used later to import the complete path of your project directory in any file.
    Args: 
    project_name : Name of your project.
    project_directory_path : Path to your project's root directory

    Returns: Nothing to return ehh!

> get_project_path(project_name:str)
Fetch the path of a project.
    Args:
    - project_name (str): Name of the project.
    Returns:
    - str or None: Path of the project if found, None otherwise.

> remove_project_path(project_name:str)

    Args: 
    project_name : Name of your project that you wish to remove.
    Returns: Nothing to return ehh!
