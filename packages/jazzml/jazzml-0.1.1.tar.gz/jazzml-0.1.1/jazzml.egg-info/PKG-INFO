# Welcome to jazzml!

`jazzml` is a lightweight package to decode both json and yaml documents.

It does so by allowing the user to first specify a Decoder and then apply it to a json/yaml document.

A Decoder can be viewed as a specification of the expected structure of a json/yaml document.

This 2 step strategy brings some level of implicit checking. That is, if a document structure does not conform to the Decoder, the parsing fail.

Other nice features of `jazzml` include the possibility to define Decoders for recursive data structures and to dynamically choose a Decoder based on some specific value defined by the json/yaml document.

You'll find a more complete documentation on [readthedocs.io](https://jazzml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)

I hope you'll enjoy it.
