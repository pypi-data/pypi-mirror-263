## Team Communication

We currently do not have a slack channel or a team email.
Please use Github for reporting issues and making requests.

## How to Contact Us

The following types of actions can be moved to the appropriate section and more added.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Managers or roles and specific situations they should be contacted for outside the team channel.

(this is set up this way so that the document can easily be changed if there are new members on the team)

| Role           | Name               | Preferred contact method |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| maintainer     | Denis Engemann     | email                    |

## Outbound Communication

At this point, all outbound communication will happen through release notes and public issues on Github.
In the future, new releases may be announced on Twitter/X too.

## Documentation Contacts

Tell how to find the owner, responsible party, or group people should contact if they have questions about documentation in the repo.

Describe this communication process.

For example:

* If you have questions on a specific piece of documentation, you can find the team member responsible for the information by using git blame.
* You can contact the responsible party by sending an email or tagging the user in a public issue.
