# Data Exporter for Gmail Label Email Processor

The `data_exporter` module is a key component of the Gmail Label Email Processor toolkit, designed to export processed email data into a CSV file. It provides a straightforward and efficient way to save extracted email addresses and other relevant data, making it ideal for further analysis or integration with other tools.

## Features

- Export extracted email addresses to a CSV file.
- Simple interface for specifying output file paths.
- Integrates seamlessly with the Gmail Message Processor to handle large datasets.

## Installation

Before using the `data_exporter`, ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Since `data_exporter` is part of the Gmail Label Email Processor toolkit, you should clone the entire repository to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gmail-label-email-processor.git
cd gmail-label-email-processor
```

No additional Python packages are required specifically for data_exporter, but ensure all dependencies for the Gmail Label Email Processor toolkit are installed.


## Usage

To use the data_exporter module, import it into your Python script where you're processing Gmail data. Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to export a list of email addresses:

```bash
from data_exporter import export_emails_to_csv

# Example list of email addresses
email_addresses = ['example1@example.com', 'example2@example.com']

# Specify the output CSV file path
output_file_path = 'exported_emails.csv'

# Export the email addresses
export_emails_to_csv(email_addresses, output_file_path)

print(f'Email addresses have been exported to {output_file_path}')
```

Replace the email_addresses list with your actual data processed through the Gmail Label Email Processor toolkit.
