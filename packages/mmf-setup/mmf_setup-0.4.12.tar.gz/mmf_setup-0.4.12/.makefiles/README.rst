Makefiles: README branch
========================

A collection of Makefiles and related tools supporting the following features:

* Simple conversion of ``README.rst`` files to ``README.html`` files using
  docutils.

This branch only provides the README features that converts ``README.rst`` files
to ``README.html`` files for local viewing.

Requirements
============
Requires the ``rst2html.py`` script which is provided by the docutils_ package.
(The script location can be customized by the ``RST2HTML`` variable.)

Usage
=====
A simple use (I have started using this for all my projects) is to include a
top-level ``Makefile`` of the form::

   makefiles_dir = .makefiles
   include $(makefiles_dir)/rst2html.mk

By default, this will convert ``README.rst`` files to ``README.html`` files in
the same directory (you might like to ignore these in your ``.hgignore`` file
for example).  You can customize this behaviour with the following variables:

   ``README (= README.rst)``:
      Name of input files.
   ``RST_HTML_INPUT``:
      Input directory.  This will be searched using ``find
      "$(RST_HTML_INPUT)" -type f -name "$(README)"``. 
   ``RST_HTML_OUTPUT``:
      Output directory (will have the same directory structure as the input
      directory.)
   ``RST2HTML (= rst2html.py)``:
       Name of ``rst2html.py`` command.
