Configurations for your CoCalc project have been symlinked as described above.

If you use version control, then to get the most of the configuration, please make sure
that you set the following variables on your personal computer, and forward them when
you ssh to the project.  This can be done with your SSH config file (~/.ssh/config)
which might look like (or use SendEnv if you define them in your environment):

    # ~/.ssh/config
    Host cc-project1
      User ff1cb986f...
    
    Host cc*
      HostName ssh.cocalc.com
      ForwardAgent yes
      SetEnv LC_HG_USERNAME=Your Full Name <your.email.address+hg@gmail.com>
      SetEnv LC_GIT_USEREMAIL=your.email.address+git@gmail.com
      SetEnv LC_GIT_USERNAME=Your Full Name
      SetEnv LC_EDITOR=vi
