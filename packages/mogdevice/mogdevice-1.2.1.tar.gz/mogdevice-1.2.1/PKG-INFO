# MOGdevice â€’ moglabs device class

This is an unofficial repository. It uses the [Python drivers](https://www.moglabs.com/support/software/connection/mogdevice_py_v1.2.zip) from the [MOGLabs website](https://www.moglabs.com) and turned it into a installable package.

## Basic functionality for MOGLabs devices

You can import a class that allows for communication with MOGLabs devices by running

```python
from mogdevice import MOGDevice
```

and connecting to a device by running

```python
dev = MOGDevice("IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE")
```

## High-level class for MOGLabs QRF

Based on the `MOGDevice` class, this package provides a higher level class for the 
Quad RF Synthesizer (QRF) that implements a subset of the commands as methods and
properties. Connect to a device with

```python
from mogdevice.qrf import QRF
qrf = QRF("IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE")
```
