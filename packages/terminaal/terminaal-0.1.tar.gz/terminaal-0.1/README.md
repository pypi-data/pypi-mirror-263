## Installation

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Verify by running python3 --version in your terminal.

2. Dependencies: The program relies on certain external libraries. Install them using pip:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Program: Execute the main Python script (e.g., main.py) using the command prompt or terminal:

```bash
pip install terminal
```

## Usage

Run the Program: Execute the main Python script (e.g., main.py) using the command prompt or terminal:

```Bash

```

## Interact with the Assistant:

You'll be greeted by "Welcome to the assistant bot!". Type a command and press Enter. Here are some examples:

- `add John 1234567890` : Create a new contact named "John Doe" with phone number "123-456-7890".
- `phone John` : Display the phone number of "John Doe".
- `change-birthday` : John Doe 2000-01-01: Update the birthday of "John Doe" to "2000-01-01".
- `add-email John johndoe@example.com` : Add an email address "johndoe@example.com" to "John Doe".
- `show-address Jane` : View the address of "Jane Smith".
- `add-note` : This is a reminder for John Doe.: Add a note associated with "John Doe".
- `show-notes` : Display all notes.
- `help` : Display a list of available commands.
- `exit` : Terminate the program.

## Explanation of Commands

A detailed list of available commands will be provided within the program itself (using the help command) or documented elsewhere (consider creating a separate commands.md file for a more comprehensive list).

Data Storage (Optional)

The program can load and save data to a persistent storage mechanism like JSON files or a database (depending on your implementation). This ensures that your contact information is preserved even if you exit the program.

## Additional Considerations

Customization: You can extend the program's functionality to handle more complex tasks, such as searching contacts by various criteria, generating birthday reminders, or integrating with other personal management tools.
Security: If you plan to store sensitive information, explore secure data storage and encryption techniques.
