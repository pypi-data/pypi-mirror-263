# Overview

This repo does a few things. It is a website, a web crawler for test poses, and a gesture recognizer. 
You can view the website at jscray.art, the website mostly just a stub. The website is a cloudfare CDN and is listening to the master branch and pointing to the dist directory.

Web scraping for poses it scrapes american sign language gestures from handspeak.com. It stores these 
gestures in csv files making them accessible for tests, etc.

Currently in development is a gesture recognizer. We have tests in transcribe-asl/tests/ which compare our transcribed gestures to tests we are using to judge the accuracy of the gesture recognizer.

In a future state, we would like to recognize gestures in real time.

# How you can contribute
We need all types of feedback. Whether it's the ease of installation or how the website looks.
