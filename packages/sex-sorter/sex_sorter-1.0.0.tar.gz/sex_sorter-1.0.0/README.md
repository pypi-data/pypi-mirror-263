# character-sex-sorter

This package allows the user to call it via python -m and to sort all *.png files in a directory based on the sex of the depicted characters.

The sorter will create the following folders boy, girl, fury, other in which the images are moved.


This package was primary created to increase efficency of my StableDiffusion workflow.
