1
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,500
Ever since I was a young boy
I played the silver ball

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,460
From Soho down to Brighton
I must've played them all

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,500
But I ain't seen nothin' like
him in any amusement hall

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,270
That deaf, dumb, and blind
kid sure plays a mean pinball

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He stands like a statue,

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,230
becomes part of the machine

7
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,345
Feeling all the bumpers,
always playing clean

8
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:04,980
He plays by intuition,

9
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,855
the digit counters fall

10
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:12,680
That deaf, dumb, and blind
kid sure plays a mean pinball

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
He's a pinball wizard,

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
there has to be a twist

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,000
A pinball wizard's got
such a supple wrist

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
(How do you think he does it?)

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't know

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,500
(What makes him so good?)

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
Well, he ain't got
no distractions,

18
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,540
can't hear no buzzes and bells

19
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,255
Don't see lights a-flashin',

20
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,190
he plays by sense of smell

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,550
Always has a replay,
never tilts at all

22
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,000
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid
sure plays a mean pinball

23
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,000
He can't beat me now,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've always been the champ

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know every trick,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
no freak's gonna beat my hand

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Even on my usual table

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
he can beat the best

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,500
His disciples lead him in

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
and he just does the rest

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's got crazy flipper fingers,

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've never seen him fall

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
sure plays a mean pinball

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
He's a pinball wizard,

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
there has to be a twist

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A pinball wizard's got

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,500
such a supple wrist

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He's a pinball wizard,

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
he scores a trillion more

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A pinball wizard,

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
the world's new pinball lord

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He's scoring more,

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
he's scoring more!

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I thought I was the
Bally table king,

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but I just handed

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
my pinball crown to him

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
To him, to him!
