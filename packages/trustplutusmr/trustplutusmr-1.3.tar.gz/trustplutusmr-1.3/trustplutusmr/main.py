The Japanese investors stake in Paytm stood at approximately 5% as of January, a significant decrease from the approximately 18.5% stake it held around the time of Paytms initial public offering in 2021.When asked about SoftBanks plans regarding its remaining stake, Govil declined to comment.Earlier Paytm has received multiple warnings from regulators over the past two years regarding transactions between its popular payments app and its banking arm.
