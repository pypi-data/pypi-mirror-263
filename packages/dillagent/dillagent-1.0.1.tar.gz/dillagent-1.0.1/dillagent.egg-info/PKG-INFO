DillAgent is an AI agent library based on the principles of ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. While there are existing libraries such as Langchain, Langroid, and Llamaindex, DillAgent takes a different approach by prioritizing modularity and abstraction to provide developers with more control over their LLM-powered applications.
