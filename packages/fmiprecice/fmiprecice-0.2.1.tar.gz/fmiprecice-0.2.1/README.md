# preCICE-FMI Runner

A tool to couple FMU models with other simulation tools via the coupling library [preCICE](https://precice.org/).

The main documentation is rendered on the [preCICE website](https://precice.org/tooling-fmi-runner.html).

Please report [issues](https://github.com/precice/fmi-runner/issues) and give feedback through [one of the community channels](https://precice.org/community-channels.html).
