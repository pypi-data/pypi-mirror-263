Bravo!  You have received a Medical Diploma in "volts" from      
the Orbital Convergence University International Air and Water   
Embassy of the Tangerine Planet 🍊.  

You are now officially certified to include "volts" in your   
practice.

## 🥧 description
This is can ascertain   
the health status of a python3 `.py` biome. 
It's like a testing framework.

## ⛑️ install

This utilizes:     
[https://pypi.org/project/xonsh](https://pypi.org/project/xonsh)   

```
[xonsh] pip install volts
```

## 📖 documentation   
```
[xonsh] volts help 
```

This opens a server process that can be opened in a browser.

## ⚕️ internal status tests of the module
```
[xonsh] volts internal-status
```
	
These checks are run with pypi "body_scan";   
"volts" is built from a fork of "body_scan".  

The "body_scan" checks are written with "unittest".

## 🌌 Tutorial

### The structure
```
📁 performance
	📜 status_1.py
```

### The checks
```		
# status_1.py

def check_1 ():
	print ("check 1")
	
def check_2 ():
	print ("check 2")
	
def check_3 ():
	raise Exception ("not 110%")

checks = {
	"check 1": check_1,
	"check 2": check_2,
	"check 3": check_3
}
```
		
### The procedure
From the `performance` directory,   
```
[xonsh] volts status
```

#### The report
This is the report that is (hopefully) written to the terminal.  

```
paths: [
	{
		"path": "status_1.py",
		"empty": false,
		"parsed": true,
		"stats": {
			"passes": 2,
			"alarms": 1
		},
		"checks": [
			{
				"check": "check 1",
				"passed": true,
				"elapsed": [
					4.054199962411076e-05,
					"seconds"
				]
			},
			{
				"check": "check 2",
				"passed": true,
				"elapsed": [
					1.72930003827787e-05,
					"seconds"

			},
			{
				"check": "check 3",
				"passed": false,
				"exception": "Exception('not 110%')",
				"exception trace": [
					"Traceback (most recent call last):",
					"  File \"/volts/processes/scan/process/keg/check.py\", line 68, in start",
					"    checks [ check ] ()",
					"  File \"<string>\", line 13, in check_3",
					"Exception: not 110%"
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
alarms: [
	{
		"path": "status_1.py",
		"checks": [
			{
				"check": "check 3",
				"passed": false,
				"exception": "Exception('not 110%')",
				"exception trace": [
					"Traceback (most recent call last):",
					"  File \"/volts/processes/scan/process/keg/check.py\", line 68, in start",
					"    checks [ check ] ()",
					"  File \"<string>\", line 13, in check_3",
					"Exception: not 110%"
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
stats: {
	"alarms": 0,
	"empty": 0,
	"checks": {
		"passes": 2,
		"alarms": 1
	}
}
```
	
### Notes
- Checks are started simultaneously, unless `--simultaneous no`
	- `[xonsh] volts status --simultaneous no`

- The fractory glob pattern is "**/status_*.py", but can be changed with `--glob-string`  
    - `[xonsh] volts status --glob-string "**/performance_*.py"`

## Advanced Tutorial   

It's recommended to run volts in a .py script.    

An example of this can be found in the "_book/advanced tutorial"  
section of the documentation.

## Pythons as companions
It seems like every kind of known "python" is non-venomous.        
      
Nevertheless, pythons are carnivorous constrictors that kill prey by   
wrapping around them and squeezing tightly.  
   
There are very big python species like "reticulated pythons" 
that can grow to over 20 feet and thusly can squeeze and kill 
a human very fast.   

However, Python species like "Ball", "Woma" and "Children's" pythons
usually don't grow past 5 feet long.

"Burmese" and "Carpet" pythons can also be great companions;
they can grow to like 10 to 20 feet though.

Dangers aside, pythons are great friends for
agriculture as they reduce the rodent population.
