    Parameters
    ----------
    seasonal_periodicity: int, default=1
        A integer for defining the seasonal period of the series forecasting.

    Returns
    -------
    sktime.forecasting.naive.NaiveForecaster

    This function builds a LightGBM model using the sktime method and returns a
    forecasting pipeline which can be used to fit and predict the time series data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    summarize_period: List[int], default=[24, 48, 72]
        The period at which the window summarizer transformer will be applied and
        calculate the lag, mean and std.
        For eg. [24, 48, 72] indicate: lag of 72 period, mean and std of first
        24 period, then 48 period and last 72 period.
        Note: Period can be sort of duration, in the above example it is hours.

    model_params: Dict[str, Any] or None, default=None
        A dict containing the hyperparameters of the LightGBM model.
        If None is provided then model is build with default parameters.

    Returns
    -------
    sktime.forecasting.compose.ForecastingPipeline
        A sktime forecasting pipeline is returned containing the LightGBM model and
        all the necessary transformer, this can be used for training and predicting.
