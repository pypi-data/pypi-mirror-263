    This functions get the batch data from hopsworks feature view and process the batch
    data into the sktime data format for hierarchical dataset and then returns the
    input and target dataset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_store: FeatureStore
        A instance of FeatureStore object that is connected to the hopsworks feature
        store and the project in which the data is stored.

    start_datetime: datetime.datetime
        A starting date and time for extracting the batch data
        from hopsworks feature view.

    end_datetime: datetime.datetime
        A ending date and time for extracting the batch data
        from hopsworks feature view.

    feature_view_ver: int, default=1
        The feature view version that needs to be loaded.

    feature_view_name: str, default="denmark_energy_consumption_view"
        The name of the feature view in the hopsworks feature store.

    target_feature: str, default="consumption_kwh"
        The name of the target feature in the dataset.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame]
            Dataframe split in Input and Target sets as per sktime format: X, y.
