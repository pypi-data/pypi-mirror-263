> TODO or not to do, that is the question

TODO Or Not (#todoon) is, in essence, a simple tool that checks your project for TODO's and FIXME's. You can also integrate this tool into your GitHub workflow via actions, and automate generating issues from the discovered TODO's and FIXME's.

[Get the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/todo-or-not)

[Try it out! (see on PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/todo-or-not/)

```bash
pip install todo-or-not
```

```py
##########################
# Example usage of #todoon
##########################

def an_unfinished_function():
    # TODO Finish documenting todo-or-not
    print("Hello, I'm not quite done, there's more to do!")
    print("Look at all these things I have to do!")
    a = 1 + 1
    b = a * 2
    print("Okay I'm done!")


def a_broken_function():
    # This line might not show up in the generated issue because it's too far away
    #  from the line that triggered the issue.
    # The search for pertinent lines will stop when it hits a line break or the
    #  maximum number of lines, set by PERTINENT_LINE_LIMIT
    a = [
        1, 1, 2, 3
    ]
    b = sum(a)
    c = b * len(a)
    return c / 0  # FIXME I just don't know why this doesn't work!
    # Notice that this line will be collected

    # But this one won't, because there's some whitespace between it and the trigger!


def a_skipping_example():
    # Since the line below has #todoon in it, the checker will give it a pass even though it has the magic words!
    print("Sometimes you really have to write TODO or FIXME, like this!")  # #todoon


def a_very_pretty_example():
    # TODO Titled Issue! | In this format, you can define a title and a body! Also labels like #example or #enhancement
    print("Check this out!")
```

## Usage

### CLI

[[Generated by Typer, thanks Typer!](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer)]

```
Usage: todo_check.py [OPTIONS]                                              
                                                                            
Options:                                                                    
  --mode TEXT             [default: print]                                  
  --silent / --no-silent  [default: no-silent]                              
  --force / --no-force    [default: no-force]                               
  --ni TEXT               Copy the contents of other files into a new .todo-
                          ignore                                            
  --xi TEXT               Copy the contents of other files into an existing 
                          .todo-ignore                                      
  --help                  Show this message and exit.       
```

--mode PRINT
: The default configuration, will print the discovered issues to stderr

--mode ISSUE
: Will generate issues and submit them via the [gh cli](https://cli.github.com/), with checks (see [Issues](#issues))

--silent
: Do not exit with a non-zero exit code, even if TODOs and/or FIXMEs are found

--force
: Run todo_check without a .todo-ignore. NOT RECOMMENDED! There could be a lot of files in there.

--ni FILENAME
: Copy the contents of other files into a **N**EW [.todo-ignore](#todo-ignore), this option must be specified for each. e.g. `--ni .gitignore --ni .prettierignore`

--xi FILENAME
: Copy the contents of other files into a E**X**ISTING [.todo-ignore](#todo-ignore), this option must be specified for each. e.g. `--ni .gitignore --xi .prettierignore`

If a file discovered by `todoon` is not of a supported encoding [see [SUPPORTED_ENCODINGS_TODO_CHECK](todo_or_not/localize.py) for most up-to-date list] it will be skipped.
The number of skipped files is summarized at the end of the run.

### Environment Variables

MAXIMUM_ISSUES_GENERATED
: _default: 8_ <br> If in ISSUE mode, will exit the todo_check after a certain number of issues have been generated.

PERTINENT_LINE_LIMIT
: _default: 8_ <br> The greatest number of surrounding lines (in each direction) that will be collected in the body of an issue generated in ISSUE mode (fewer may be gathered if they are broken up by blank lines)

### .todo-ignore

A plaintext file in a supported encoding.
This file specifies which files and directories that todo_check doesn't need to walk through or analyze.
It follows the same syntax as a .gitignore file. 

Supported encodings:

* UTF-8
* UTF-16

[see [SUPPORTED_ENCODINGS_TODOIGNORE](todo_or_not/localize.py) for most up-to-date list]


### Issues

Issues are generated up to a limit (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)) and contain the line which contains the TODO or FIXME and up to `$MAXIMUM_ISSUES_GENERATED` of the preceding and following lines. See [Examples](#examples) for a good representation of how these look.

Issue generation is best supported from GitHub actions, the YAML included in this repository generates the necessary credentials and keeps them safe for you, so it's the most recommended option. However, if you wish to run this elsewhere, you must supply valid values to each of the following environment variables:

- GITHUB_REF_NAME
- GITHUB_REPOSITORY
- GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR

## Settings

### Localization

Try out your #todoon in your language! In the environment that you're running `todoon` in, set the environment variable "REGION" to your ISO code (see below). For example, on Windows (PowerShell): `$env:REGION="ko_kr"`

Currently supported:

* bu_mm - Burmese
* en_us - English (US)
* ko_kr - Korean

Don't see your language? Want to do a quick localization? Please feel free to contribute!
