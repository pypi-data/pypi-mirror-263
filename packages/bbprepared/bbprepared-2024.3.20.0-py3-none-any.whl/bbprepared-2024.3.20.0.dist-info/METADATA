This work is a mixture of codes developed throughout my postdoc in the [Jelfs Group](http://www.jelfs-group.org/), and the [Pavan Group](https://www.gmpavanlab.com/), and during my time as a developer of [`stk`](https://stk.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [`stko`](https://github.com/JelfsMaterialsGroup/stko) with Lukas Turcani.
