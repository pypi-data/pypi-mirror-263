For selecting the mandate at contact level:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Customers > Customers*.
#. Open or create one contact.
#. On the "Sales & Purchase" page, fill *Contact Mandate*.

Then, when you select a payment mode that requires mandate on a sale order, Odoo will
choose the mandate selected at contact level. That mandate will be copied from the sale order to the invoice.
