# Terminal Menu using Python 

```python
from terminal_menu import menu
user_choice: str = menu(
    static_menu_text="Please choose an annoying little dog:",
    choices=("Chihuahua", "Pomeranian", "Jack Russell"),
)
print(f"user chose '{user_choice}'")
```

I wanted a simple OS-agnostic interface for creating menus in my python command-line applications (using only the python standard library). 

I could not find one that I liked, so I built this one. 

It is not truly operating system agnostic since it uses the [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses) python library, which will not work on a Windows terminal. It works on WSL though.
