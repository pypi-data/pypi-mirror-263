#  Synthesized SDK3

The SDK generates high quality, privacy-preserving datasets for machine learning and data science use cases.
It's available on PyPi for a free 30-day trial.

## Installation

It is assumed that you have Python 3.8+ already installed on a Windows, Linux
or MacOS machine.

Before starting, ensure that `pip` and `wheel` are installed and up to date.

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel
```

Synthesized can then be installed with `pip`.

```
pip install synthesized3
```

### Setting the licence key

Once you have installed the package, you'll need a licence key to run the
software. The quickest way to check if the SDK is working is by running the
command:

```shell
synth3-validate
```

The first time this is run you will be asked if you have a licence key. If you
do not have one simply select "no" and the prompts will guide you in acquiring
one by entering your email address.

With the SDK installed you are now able to get synthesizing! Check out our
tutorials or API reference documentation for ways that the SDK can be put to use.

## Dependencies

Below are the minimum dependencies required to run the SDK.
