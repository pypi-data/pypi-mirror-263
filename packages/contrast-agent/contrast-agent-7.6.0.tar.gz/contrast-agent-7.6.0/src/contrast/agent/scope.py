Controller for global scope state

Basically we use scoping to prevent us from assessing our own code. Scope
improves performance but it also prevents us from accidentally recursing
inside our analysis code. For example, we don't want to inadvertently cause
string propagation events while we're doing string building for reporting
purposes.
