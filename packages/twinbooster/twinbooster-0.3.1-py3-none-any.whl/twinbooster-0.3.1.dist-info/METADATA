### Synergising Chemical Structures and Bioassay Descriptions for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction in Drug Discovery

Maximilian G. Schuh, Davide Boldini, Stephan A. Sieber

@ Technical University of Munich, TUM School of Natural Sciences, Department of Bioscience, Center for Functional Protein Assemblies (CPA)

### Installation

Install the package with ```pip install twinbooster```.
Then you can download the pretrained models with ```twinbooster.download_models()```.
For FS-Mol, you can download the data with ```twinbooster.download_data()```.

An example script can be found here ```./twinbooster/twinbooster_example.ipynb```.
