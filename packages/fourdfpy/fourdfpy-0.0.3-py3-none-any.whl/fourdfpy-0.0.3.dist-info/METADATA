# fourdfpy

This is a (very!) simple package for converting the binary data from Avi Snider's 4dfp neuroimaging file format into a Numpy array, that can then be used in your Python scripts.

Based off of the [Julia package](https://github.com/myersm0/Fourdfp.jl) written by Michael Myers.

## Install

```bash
pip install fourdfpy
```

## Running

```python
import fourdfpy

my_4dfp_data = fourdfpy.load("/path/to/myimg")
```

The path to the 4dfp files should **only include the root name** without the
extension (example: "/path/to/myimg.4dfp.img" should instead be "/path/to/myimg").
Make sure the .4dfp.img and .4dfp.hdr files are in the same directory.

- [ ] TODO: add support for including file extension.
