# Cron Expression Parser

1. This is simple cron expression parser written in python that translates cron expression and send output in table format.

- minute
- hour
- day of month
- month
- day of week
- command

## System Requirements

- Python >=3.6
- `pipenv` Python package manager

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root folder.

2. Install all dependencies and active the virtual environment:
   ```shell
   pipenv install
   pipenv install -r requirements.txt
   pipenv shell
   pipenv install pytest
   ```

3. Install the package as a binary.
   ```shell
   pip install --editable .
   ```

4. Now you have access to `cron-parser` binary. Run the program with a cron expression as an argument. For example:
