# dualPredictor

by D

`dualPredictor` is a Python package that can provide simultaneous **regression** and **binary classification** results for tabular datasets. 


- **Simultaneous Predictions**: A model that perform **regression** and binary **classification** tasks simultaneously
- **Regressor Selection (choose one)**: Choose from **Lasso**, **Ridge**, or **LinearRegression(OLS)** as the base regression model.
- **Dynamic Cutoff Tuning metrics (choose one)**: Automatically tunes the cutoff value to maximize the **Youden index**, **F1**, or **F2** score. Users can choose a metrics type.

**1. Youden Index (J)**

 $$J= Recall + Specificity - 1$$
J is a measure of the overall performance of a binary classifier. It is calculated as the sum of the recall and specificity minus 1. A high J statistic indicates that the classifier performs well on positive and negative cases.

* **Recall** measures a classifier's ability to identify positive cases correctly. A high recall means that the classifier is avoiding miss detects.
* **Specificity** measures the ability of a classifier to identify negative cases correctly. A high specificity means that the classifier is avoiding false alarms.

**2. F scores (Option F1, F2 in Package)**

$$F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{precision + recall}$$

F1 score is another measure of the overall performance of a binary classifier. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. A high F1 score indicates that the classifier is performing well on both positive and negative cases.

$$F_\beta = (1 + \beta^2) \cdot \frac{precision \cdot recall}{\beta^2 \cdot precision + recall}$$
F-score with factor beta is a generalization of the F1 score that allows for different weights to be given to precision and recall. A beta value less than 1 indicates that the F-score is prone to precision, while a beta value greater than 1 indicates that the F-score is prone to recall.

**In educational settings**

In educational settings, avoiding miss detects (i.e., failing to identify at-risk students) is important. However, it is also important to avoid false alarms (i.e., identifying students as at-risk when they are not). Therefore, using a measure prone to recall is often desirable, such as the F1 score with beta > 1.
Youden's J statistic and the F1 score are both measures that balance the avoidance of miss detects and the avoidance of false alarms. However, Youden's J statistic is less sensitive to false alarms (Specificity is less sensitive to false alarms compared to Precision) than the F1 score.


## Installation

Install `dualPredictor` directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install dualPredictor
```
Dependencies
dualPredictor requires:
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## DualModel

The `DualModel` class is a custom regressor that combines a base regression model (lasso, ridge, or OLS) with a dual classification approach. It allows for tuning an optimal cut-off value to classify samples into two classes based on the predicted regression values.

### Parameters

- `model_type` (str, default='lasso'): The base regression model to use. Supported options are 'lasso', 'ridge', and 'ols' (Ordinary Least Squares).

- `metric` (str, default='youden_index'): The metric used to tune the optimal cut-off value. Supported options are 'f1_score', 'f2_score', and 'youden_index'. 

- `default_cut_off` (float, default=0.5): The default cut-off value used to create binary labels. Samples with regression values below the cut-off are labeled as 0, and samples above or equal to the cut-off are labeled as 1.

### Methods

- `fit(X, y)`: Fit the DualModel to the training data.

    - Parameters:
        - `X` (array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)): The input training data.
        - `y` (array-like of shape (n_samples,)): The target values.

    - Returns:
        - `self`: Fitted DualModel instance.

- `predict(X)`: Predict the input data's regression values and binary classifications.

    - Parameters:
        - `X` (array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)): The input data for prediction.

    - Returns:
        - `grade_predictions` (array-like of shape (n_samples,)): The predicted regression values.
        - `class_predictions` (array-like of shape (n_samples,)): The predicted binary classifications based on the optimal cut-off.

### Attributes

* **`alpha_`**: The alpha value of the model. This value is only available if the model is a Lasso or Ridge regression model. (OLS do not have alpha)
* **`coef_`**: The coefficients of the model.
* **`intercept_`**: The intercept of the model.
* **`feature_names_in_`**: The names of the features used to train the model.
* **`optimal_cut_off`**: The optimal cut-off value determined by the specified metric.
* **`y_label_true_`**: The true binary labels are generated using the default cut-off value.
  
### Example

```python
# Import the DualModel class
from dual_model import DualModel

# Initializing and fitting the DualModel
# 'ols' for Ordinary Least Squares, a default cut-off value is provided
# The metric parameter specifies the method to tune the optimal cut-off
dual_clf = DualModel(model_type='ols', metric='youden_index', default_cut_off=1)
dual_clf.fit(X, y)

# Accessing the true binary labels generated based on the default cut-off
y_label_true = dual_clf.y_label_true_

# Retrieving the optimal cut-off value tuned based on the Youden Index
optimal_cut_off = dual_clf.optimal_cut_off

# Predicting grades (y_pred) and binary classification (at-risk or not) based on the optimal cut-off (y_label_pred)
y_pred, y_label_pred = dual_clf.predict(X)
```
