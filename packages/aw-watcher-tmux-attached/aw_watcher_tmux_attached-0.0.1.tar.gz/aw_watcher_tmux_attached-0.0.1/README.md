# aw-watcher-tmux-attached

This is a watcher service for [ActivityWatch](https://activitywatch.net/).

Unlike [aw-watcher-tmux](https://github.com/akohlbecker/aw-watcher-tmux) it does not record actual activity in tmux, but only the names of currently attached sessions.

The intention is work time tracking through attaching/deattaching Tmux sessions.
