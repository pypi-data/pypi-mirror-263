# spcqe
Smooth (multi-) periodic consistent quantile estimation. We attempt to follow the sklearn "fit/transform" API, and the main class inherets `TransformerMixin` and `BaseEstimator` from `sklearn.base`.


## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and install with pip by navigating to the project directory and running:

```
pip install .
```

If working on the files in this package (i.e. fixing bugs or adding features), it useful to install in [editable mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html):

```
pip install -e .
```


## Usage

```
from spcqe.quantiles import SmoothPeriodicQuantiles

y1 = ... # some data with hourly measurement exhibiting daily, weekly, and yearly periodicities
P1 = int(365*24)
P2 = int(7*24)
P3 = int(24)
K = 3
l = 0.1
spq = SmoothPeriodicQuantiles(K, [P1, P2, P3], weight=l)
spq.fit(y1)
```

## Examples 

Many examples Jupyter notebooks are available in the `notebooks` folder.
