A Python-based STUN/TURN client can be used for testing purposes to assess network connectivity, troubleshoot NAT traversal issues, and ensure proper configuration of STUN/TURN servers. It typically sends STUN requests to a STUN server to obtain network information and may utilize TURN servers as relays when direct communication between peers is blocked by firewalls or NAT devices.
